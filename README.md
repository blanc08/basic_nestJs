- Cant sign in because the new user's passsword arent hashed well
- I did createUser, but it should be signUp !!!!!wrong query

- createUser query deleted

- i cant find any good referense how to use the complexity feature correcly,
  what i'm doing here is just to set the default complexity to 0, then put 1 to each Query's complexity cost
  - Thus, We'll only can do 3 nested query
